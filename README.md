        This animal detection model is a pretrained model utilizing YoloV7 to do transfer learning to utilize the base weights of YoloV7 to specifically identify the desired animals from a dataset that was obtained off Kaggle. The images were annotated and bounding boxes were placed using Roboflow.

<h2> Examples </h2>
Examples videos can be obtained from my drive <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19156fSAxYwLcZza1mOn4T7gf-dLpgMki?usp=drive_link">Link to Google Drive</a>
 and so can the pt file weights that were trained.

<h2> Screenshot of Gradio Front End </h2>
The app uses a very basic Gradio Frontend application to input a youtube link and get the detected video as our output.
